In the prompt, you will be given an article and the name of a company. You shall extract quotes from the article related to those three questions:

1. The company has mentioned/announced that it will stop its business in Russia. Note that this one is about what companies say, not necessarily what companies actually do.

The quotes should be full sentences with a period at its end.

Your answers shall only contain quotes to those answers. The quotes shall be strictly copies from the original text, without any modifications.
